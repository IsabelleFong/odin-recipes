# Odin - Recipe Website

## A simple static website that displays recipes of various dishes

This project is a part of The Odin Project Foundations Course (HTML Foundations) to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. This project shows how to do the following:
 
 * Create an index.html file with HTML boilerplate and add an h1 heading "Odin Recipes"
 * Create a new directory named recipes
 * Inside recipes, create HTML files for each recipe with an h1 heading
 * Link recipe pages to the index.html
 * Organize links to recipes in an unordered list
 * Add an image, description, ingredients list, and steps to each recipe page
